# Problem Statement: Enhanced Platooning for Energy Efficiency and Safety

## Description
Design a platooning system that uses machine learning algorithms to enhance energy efficiency and safety. The project will focus on optimizing the platooning configuration (e.g., vehicle order, inter-vehicle distance) based on historical and real-time data.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a neural network or reinforcement learning model that learns the best platooning configurations to minimize fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
- Integrate sensor fusion techniques using data from onboard sensors (e.g., GPS, accelerometers) and external sources (e.g., cloud traffic data).
- Develop a predictive model for potential obstacles or hazardous conditions, allowing for preemptive braking or lane changing.
- Simulate and analyze the platooning performance under different scenarios such as varying traffic flow, adverse weather conditions, and road gradient changes.

## Hardware and Software Requirements
- **Microcontrollers:** ESP32 or Raspberry Pi for vehicle control.
- **Sensors:** IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), GPS modules, and LiDAR for localization and environmental perception.
- **Cloud Services:** AWS, Google Cloud, or similar for data storage and model training.
- **ML Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other Python-based machine learning libraries.
- **Simulation:** SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) or Carla for testing and validation.

## Expected Outcome
- An intelligent platooning system that adapts to real-time conditions and learns from previous scenarios to improve energy efficiency.
- Safety features, such as real-time hazard detection and avoidance, that enhance the robustness of the platoon.
- A performance evaluation of the system in terms of energy consumption, inter-vehicle distance accuracy, and response time to emergency conditions.
